# CRISPRi library analysis of effect of Lys on *Synechocystis*

This repository collects the analysis for the *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 CRISPRi library (compare [Miao et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/35/11/3937/7231705?login=true)) when grown in the presence of 25 ÂµM lysine in comparison to a library without added amino acid. For analysis, sequencing files were processed using the [nf-core-crispriscreen workflow](https://github.com/MPUSP/nf-core-crispriscreen). For further analyses and visualization, the R programming language was used.

The pooled CRISPRi library was cultured as described in [Miao et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/35/11/3937/7231705?login=true). The pooled strains were cultivated at turbidostat mode with a set optical density of OD730 ~ 0.2. Lysine was added 24 h after addition of aTc to cultivation tubes and feed bottles. 

# Preparing input files

Collect all relevant input files in [input](../input).

* [Synechocystis_v2_trimmed.fasta](../input/Synechocystis_v2_trimmed.fasta) is the library of used sgRNAs
* [samplesheet_CRISPRi_Lys.csv](../input/samplesheet_CRISPRi_Lys.csv) gives which sample is which
* the respective .fastq.gz files are collected in the folder (../input/fastq)[../input/fastq] and are the output of a sequencing run on a NextSeq 2000 system.

Try once with limma normalization and once without. Command for run without limma normalization: 

```
conda activate env_nf
nextflow run ../../pipelines/nf-core-crispriscreen/ -profile singularity --input "input/samplesheet_CRISPRi_Lys.csv" --fasta "input/Synechocystis_v2_trimmed.fasta" --outdir "results" --three_prime_adapter ^CAGTGATAGAGATACTGGGAGCTA...GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGC --filter_mapq=1 --max_cpus 5 --max_memory 12GB --run_mageck true --gene_fitness true
```

Command for run with limma normalization:

```
conda activate env_nf
