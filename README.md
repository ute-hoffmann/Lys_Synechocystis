# CRISPRi library analysis of effect of Lys on *Synechocystis*

This repository collects the analysis for the *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 CRISPRi library (compare [Miao et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/35/11/3937/7231705?login=true)) when grown in the presence of 25 ÂµM lysine in comparison to a library without added amino acid. For analysis, sequencing files were processed using the [nf-core-crispriscreen workflow](https://github.com/MPUSP/nf-core-crispriscreen). For further analyses and visualization, the R programming language was used.

The pooled CRISPRi library was cultured as described in [Miao et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/35/11/3937/7231705?login=true). The pooled strains were cultivated at turbidostat mode with a set optical density of OD730 ~ 0.2. Lysine was added 24 h after addition of aTc to cultivation tubes and feed bottles.
